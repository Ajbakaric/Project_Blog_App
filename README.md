# Blog App

This is a simple blog web application built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. The goal was to practice working with a Ruby on Rails backend, manage models and relationships, and create a basic CRUD system for posts and comments.

##  Features

- Create, edit, and delete blog posts
- Comment on individual posts
- Basic authentication for users (if implemented)
- Clean and minimal Rails MVC structure
